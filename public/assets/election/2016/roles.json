            "statement": "Receiving my acceptance letter into Informatics was a dream come true; I love technology, but more importantly, I love people. As I’m sure many people are aware of, Informatics has an absolutely amazing community. The current IUGA executive board has done a great job thus far welcoming the new cohort, maintaining the strong relationship with the iSchool faculty and staff, and planning events for the student body.\nI want to be the next IUGA president because ever since I first heard of Informatics, I was hooked. Attending the events as a prospective student really further confirmed that this was the right program for me. I got to learn about the different opportunities within the major, and I realized how interested I was in cybersecurity and data science. With our community, we can establish lasting and meaningful connections.\nThe IUGA president must be able to represent the Informatics major, both to prospective students and as liaison between the iSchool faculty, staff, and students. As a TA for INFO 200, I already love representing the major to students who are interested. I will never pass up the opportunity to talk about how fantastic our program is, especially because of how great our faculty and cohort are.\nInclusiveness is another primary focus of mine; while community is important, it is more important to ensure diversity and that every member within the community feels valued. As president, I’ll do my best to build upon the current efforts being made by collaborating with the many diversity groups at the iSchool and the UW community as a whole."

Many of you already know me, and know that I am passionate about and dedicated to our major and community.\nI came into UW as an intended Mechanical Engineering major. I quickly learned this wasn’t the right path and transitioned to Business. Soon thereafter, I discovered Informatics and fell in love. I switched my track immediately, and the rest is history.\nI love that our community is really more like a family - and I want our family to grow.  I want more involvement from prospective students and alumni.  I want more diversity in thought and background for us to gain a broader perspective, because that is exactly what drives us - understanding and helping others.\nBeing president is all about bringing people together.  I want to unite us by creating opportunities for all of us to interact and do what we love. This can happen in any event or forum, whether it’s for philanthropy, fun, and professional development!\nI want to plan and host a charity-focused hackathon where we donate our time and code for a cause.  If you are also passionate about this idea, check out this website: http://donatecode.com/.\nI want to bring my iSchool family (#inFam anyone?) together at a Seattle sports game. Picture us at the next Mariners game, with the sun out, all sharing garlic fries, and talking about Greg Hay.\nI want to have an event which brings our current students and alumni together. We can meet in a casual setting to discuss careers, professional development, and Greg Hay.\nI will work to make your fantastic ideas a reality.  A vote for me is a vote for family, creative ideas, and fun."

My mother is from Korea, and my father is from Pennsylvania. I was born at a very young age and fortunately, I have been a Washington resident since I was 5! In my spare time, I enjoy running, playing league of legends or Call of Duty, and shopping for food.\nWith a few years of working retail and other odd jobs, I have been able to focus on the customer relationship side of the work industry. After leaving high school, I worked as a lead instructor for Coding With Kids during my freshman year. That position gave me the opportunity to teach the fundamental concepts of Java programming to various elementary school students by using the program called “Scratch”. After that position, I moved to being an Orientation Leader for this past summer. In the OL position, I helped introduced hundreds to thousands of incoming students to the UW campus with a team and worked extensively to help make sure they knew every resource possible. After this previous summer, I started as an Intern working for CDW. In that position, I conversed and worked with IT directors in all of the UW departments to help integrate technology to help in any way possible.\nI am passionate about inclusion, diversity, and leadership development. Currently I am studying Informatics (like all of you) and am focusing in Information Assurance & Cyber security! You will come to find that I laugh at awkward moments and thoroughly enjoy my puns intended. In my past experiences I’ve learned that I really do enjoy helping people and want to push that mindset into my post-graduation employment in hopes to better this community!"

Regardless of whether that first one exists or not, you can count on me to implore Scott about the possibility.\nYou see, IUGA organizes a lot of fun events for students to enjoy when they're not busy crying about CSE 373. The issue is that a very small percentage of our student body actually attends! Instead of catering to a small group of regulars, I will focus on growing our community to include more INFolks.

            "statement": "In my mind what separates Informatics from other majors on campus, and IUGA from other student government organizations, is community. Our community is unique in its inclusiveness, engagement, fun, and creativity. I have yet to meet a single Info major, or even prospective, that wasn’t excited and enthusiastic about contributing towards making Informatics great. As Info 200 TA, i’ve meet hundreds of prospectives and incoming students, and from attending and even hosting Info events i’ve gotten to know many of the current and former Info majors. The one common thread amongst them all is a personal drive to make things better, more fun, and more engaging.\nThe most important thing i’ve learned from this positive community environment, is that it is not an accident. Behind the scenes there are many organizers, many people putting up money, time, energy, and their reputations on the line to make sure that the stage is set for a positive community. Specifically, it’s the relentless drive of a few individuals determined to make sure that stage is set, that guarantees that the core driver of a positive community isn’t dissolved and slowly phased out. Recognition of this, and a personal drive to be the spearhead in driving the positivity and engagement of the community, is why I want to be Director of PR. A great community happens when someone makes it happen, I want to be that someone, I want to both continue the tradition of Info being a fun place to be, and make it better than it ever was before."

I love this community so much and even though I am only in my second quarter of (officially) being a part of this community, so many of you have already impacted my life. I love being a part of this family or “INFam” as several of us have started referring to us as. Our community is such a welcoming one and we have our previous IUGA officers to thank for that. I want to continue this love train into the next generation of prospective, newly admitted, and current members of our family. After all, one of the main facets of Informatics is People. That is what makes our major so unique. I am Parker Duvall and you can bet your anus that I will do everything in my power to further strengthen our Informatics family. Thank you so much for considering myself for this position; I look forward to getting to know all of you!"

I believe networking is the key so I want to reach out internally too so more of you can come out to our events and I’ll create an opportunity for you to network with other Info students as well as other businesses that I will reach out to.\nWhat does IUGA and INFO mean to me? I’d say it’s like taking a blender, putting in challenges and support, and mixing the two together to create an experience that helps you really learn and grow as a person. What do I mean? Well the classes will spank you outside your comfort zone and catapult you into this new area you were too scared to explore before. But by taking risks, you can reach a lot of accomplishments that you didn’t think you were capable of doing before. Now there are going to be times when these challenges get harder and harder and life just uppercuts you in the throat and you get knocked down. But when I do get knocked down, I know there’s always going to be a teammate who runs back for me and reaches his or her hand out to pick me back up. This supportive atmosphere is what Informatics is to me. I remember when I just got into Informatics, Austin Woehrle approached me from behind and he whispered in my ear, “Success is not about competing with others, it is about working together to create something better.” That is the attitude I want to bring in and spread when I become outreach."

I know I would be a great bridge between the iSchool and professionals because of my skill set and my ability to convey to employers the value of Informatics. This community has helped me in so many ways, and I want the opportunity to return the favor.\nI have a debt of gratitude to Informatics alumni. I discovered Informatics on the off chance by meeting a past graduate. Their passion got hooked on the major and the people. All the pieces of the puzzle really fell together when I found Informatics, and I would love to help support the community by reaching out to alumni in the same way that they reached out to me.\nI know how to plan professional events, and I can communicate the value that Informatics can offer employers.

The first thing I heard about the Informatics program was how supportive the community of students, faculty, and staff is. As I attended information sessions, essay workshops, capstone, and IUGA game night I saw first hand we have a special community that, among other things, sets us apart from other programs.\nAs a transfer student from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) our community has made me feel welcome at the iSchool and helped eased my transition to a new university. While at CU I had the privilege of serving on the University of Colorado Student Government (CUSG) as the Speaker of the Representative Council. CUSG is unique in that students leaders are responsible for and have final say over allocating and managing a yearly budget of thirty six million dollars to operate student funded programs and services. As a representative I participated in these budget processes and advocated for funding for student programs that supported underrepresented student groups and fostered diversity on the CU campus. In addition to my experience on CUSG, in my time between schools I have had the amazing experience of founding my own IT Consulting company. There I help clients organize their finances by communicating with their accountants and bookkeepers directly to implement accounting systems that provide all those involved the information they need to keep the company's books up to date.\nAs Director of Finance I look forward to contributing my business and leadership experience to further IUGA's goals, learning about what makes the Information School community so strong, and to meeting each of you."

To Mina, Informatics and IUGA are places to emphasize learning from each other, inclusive knowledge for the community by the community. As a child of immigrants, Mina understands the difficulties of understanding foreign cultures and hopes to welcome diverse audiences through hosting guest panels, workshops, and open discussions. She also knows how weird it is to learn English from TV and wonder why people look at you funny when you say “y’all” in the Pacific Northwest.\nBecause of her curious (read: indecisive) nature, Mina’s studied in several fields that have given her the fundamental skills in spouting fun facts at parties. She’s worked as a TA in honors, psychology, and GWSS courses, a software engineer intern, in administration for activist clubs and nonprofits, and currently as a writing tutor.\nMina’s research is focused on increasing participation of underrepresented identities in STEM. She performs hecka metadata research to analyze Informatics practices in order to suggest more inclusive techniques. She’s also studied abroad in Rome and Amsterdam, looking at strategies of immigrant integration in a global context.\nMina’s greatest accomplishments include being fluent in chicken-clucking, borrowing a pen from Anita Sarkeesian, and going on record to discuss how she would physically fight someone to defend Star Wars’ Finn and Rey (though they could definitely beat you up themselves). When not working, you can find Mina experimenting with risky baking styles, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the fruit flies rebelliously squatting on her cacti, and skyping with her cat."

Other than that, I think I covered my strengths well enough in my video, so I’ll just take this opportunity to talk about myself… Keep reading if you want to know some random facts about me.\nI’ll start off with my favorite movies – animation-wise, How To Train Your Dragon and The Incredibles. As for live-action films, I’m a huge fan of the Dark Knight trilogy as well as Love Actually. I used to play the cello, and some of my best memories growing up were from playing in orchestras. I love to dance, but I’m not that great at it… I’ve been vegetarian since the 5th grade because I really loved (and still love) dogs, and reasoned that if I wouldn’t eat a dog, then I shouldn’t eat other animals either. I cry very easily at sad or sentimental situations, and am not ashamed to admit that I’ve teared up multiple times while binge-watching ATLA.  My favorite fruit is strawberry, my favorite flavor is chocolate, and my favorite type of food is Italian though I would never say no to Pad Thai and spring rolls at Araya’s. Lastly, I’d actually love to get to know more of the iUGA community, so please feel free to introduce yourself to me sometime or shoot me a message on Facebook!
