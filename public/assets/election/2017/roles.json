As a second-year INFO student, the time I’ve spent in this program has been even more exciting, because I feel included and welcomed in this community. When I was 18, I moved here, not knowing anyone or anything about Seattle. It was very new experience for me but also a struggle. Like most of the international students, I struggled telling people about my name and identity, as some of them even never tried to understand the meaning behind these identities.\nBeing in the Informatics program and involving in IUGA has been my best experience so far, because it’s my second home where I feel connected with everyone. There are INFO alums always helping us to prepare for jobs and internships. There are iHangout for us to meet current and prospective INFO students, and professional events by IUGA and Winfo to help us learn about different opportunities. Even small thing, such as, people try their best to remember my Chinese name, and always help each other in TE lab, have made me feel included, thus shaping my perspective on inclusiveness and diversity.\nI’m running to be the next IUGA president, because for me, this position means to bring everyone together, including current and prospective students, act as the liaison between students and faculty, and most importantly, make everyone feel welcomed and connected. As an Orientation Leader, Campus Tour Guide and Informatics Diversity Ambassador, I always talk to incoming students and families about how amazing Informatics is and how much I love this program because of its inclusiveness and diversity. And as president, I’ll keep collaborating with other IUGA officers and iSchool groups, such as Winfo, iEquality, iQueeries, to support this community by connecting everyone together :)"

For as long as I can remember, I have engaged in leadership and community building. From various clubs in high school to RSO’s on campus, I have led teams and have organized 400+ person events, all in the interest in making the community experiences for others as kick-ass as possible. My time as both a Resident Advisor and a Teaching Assistant while on campus has engrossed me in heightening the Husky Experience of fellow students. As the IUGA President, I would be honored to create memorable experience within the iSchool."

Two years ago, when I appplied to Informatics for the first time, they didn't reject me - I rejected them.\nAnd then I came crawling back.\nWhat changed my mind, you might ask? I had the chance to talk to some Info students about the classes they were taking, the work they were doing, and how they were liking Informatics as a whole. I was also able to see the events created by IUGA for Informatics students to take part in - it's been said many times, but the community, all of the students, the classes they take, and all of the cool things they do come together to make Informatics something special. So at the end of the year (which couldn't come soon enough), I reapplied, waited anxiously for the response, and got in! I didn't hesistate to accept, and the rest, as they say, is history...\nActually, it's not quite history yet - but I would love the chance to make history (and memes!) as IUGA's Director of Public Relations! I'd help direct events to keep the Info community strong while also putting IUGA's best foot forward to show prospectives what awaits them in Info and to prevent them from making the same mistakes (not joining Info) that I initially did. I want to make sure the Info community doesn't forget how essential they are in making Info the best major at UW - but to do that, I need you to vote for Alex Gilbert as IUGA's Director of Public Relations!"

I feel privileged by this nomination and would like to thank you all for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.\nOutside of Informatics, my time is mainly invested towards the Husky Badminton club where I am the current treasurer. I am tasked with managing the funds that will ensure we are able to continue hosting the annual Husky Badminton Tournament. The event usually includes over a hundred participants and requires proper regulation of funds to ensure that we can continue to run the annual event and the tri-weekly club sessions. As the treasurer for IUGA, I would like to continue many of the current events such as INFO game nights, iHangouts, and other social events.  In order to continue funding these event, I would like to explore more fundraising opportunities so that we may continue to host events that will promote the tight-knit family we have in the iSchool."

To foster a diverse and inclusive community serves to better the whole of society, down to each individual participating in it, and so I firmly believe in doing just that for Informatics. As far as my own experience, I am currently the VP of Finance for my sorority. Our house was founded by Jewish women in a time where Jews were incredibly discriminated against, so naturally, we have grown into an organization that actively pursues diversity in our members, and I am currently spearheading an effort to overhaul our Diversity programming to reflect this. I have also been fortunate enough to participate in a massive increase in discussion (and art) about race, gender, and sexuality in Seattle's arts community, specifically focusing on black trans/femme identifying women. I have greatly admired the dedication that faculty, staff, and student groups in Informatics have to diversity, particularly in light of the current political climate, and believe I have the passion and skills to continue and expand on that momentum. If elected, I will work closely with other Informatics organizations to expand diversity events that will not only increase awareness of challenges faced by minorities in the tech sphere today, but will also explore what we can learn from each other, celebrate our differences and bring us together as Informatics students."

Uhh mann hasn’t that been everyone’s opening statement every time they’ve recently met a recruiter or otherwise… Well mine’s usually been that and while it may get irritating to recite and repeat an elevator pitch, it is exactly what we all have in common. Being a part of Informatics is honestly such a prize. All of us are collaborative, friendly and just straight up excited personalities am i right? But honestly, all of this wouldn’t be without the diversity that each one of us brings to the table. I still remember when Royce, the current Director of Diversity Efforts (who am I kidding, everyone knows Royce :)) reached out to all of the prospective Informatics students to edit and read through their application essays. I found him extremely approachable and just like everyone I’ve met in Info, genuinely helpful! As Director of Diversity Efforts, I really want to focus on generating a positive community. And as cheesy as that sounds, we all really are the no bs kind. Mirroring the efforts of Royce, I would focus on mentoring prospective and incoming Info students. All of us first years are new to the major and seem to have been mingling a lot with each other. So by promoting this culture to those after us, I want to facilitate a community by opening the doors even further to more current informatics and prospective student interactions. I hope you all want to see me do that as well and vote me as the Director of Diversity Efforts! Thanks a lot and cash me ousside if you wanna chat more – haha okay that’s definitely been over used now but ayy feel free to talk to me because I’d love to meet you!"

Only then can we make them into something tangibly profound. Something that can communicate a meaningful experience.\nI live in the intersection of that process. My name is Saif, and I want to be the next Creative Director of IUGA.\nI remember my first interaction with Informatics. I remember it so clearly because it was the first time someone questioned my thinking that way. I took the Mobile App Design class in Fall 2015. This was the first INFO class I had taken, and I wasn’t even in the major. This class was an eye-opening experience for me because it made me realize that I had a natural eye for design – and I didn’t even know. It's what started my love for Informatics, and showed me a world of endless possibilities.\nOn July 28th, 2016, I was accepted into the Informatics major. This was indeed one of the greatest moments of my life.\nSince then, with each project I have committed to in my INFO classes, I’ve observed that the more I was learning about design academically, the “less” I was designing in action. Informatics put me in an arena where I began to craft around intention of efficiency through simplicity. It educated me with not just the robust technicality of design, but also help me focus on forming a deep understanding of human values.\nAs Creative Director of IUGA, I look forward to contributing my design thinking and leadership skills to exemplify what IUGA and Informatics stand for. It would be an honor to be part of an organization that highlights the essence of what Informatics is: People, Technology, Mentorship, Inspiration, and Opportunity.\nCheck out www.saifmustafa.com to see some of the work I've done – this should give you a better sense of what I love to do and what makes me want to wake up each morning.\nThank you!"
